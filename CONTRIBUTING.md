🧩 Contributing to DLT-C

Welcome to DLT-C — an open-source project that makes it easier to build and manage Data Pipelines using a No/Low Code approach.

We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing! 💡
Whether you’re fixing a bug, improving documentation, designing visuals, or spreading the word — every contribution makes a difference.

Explore the codebase — DLT-C is built with:

Python + Flask for backend

DLT for data pipeline management

Still.js for frontend components

Check the design system diagram — it’ll help you understand the architecture and data flow.
