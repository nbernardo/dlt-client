**Client DLT** is now **e2e-Data**. While the DLT library remains a core component, the rebrand avoids conflicts and reflects the platform’s expansion beyond  data pipelines.

e2e-Data/~DLT Client~ is an MVP Data Engineering project designed to build ETL pipelines through a web interface, using low/no-code
features.


The front end is built using the <a href="https://stilljs.dev/">Still.js</a> framework and the Backend is built in 
<a href="https://dlthub.com/">dlt-hub (Python)</a>. This is a single repository comprising both the backend and the UI.

There is a [live version](https://mvp2.e2e-data.com/#) deployed in the cloud as MVP2 release, you can access and test it using social login.

To learn how to set up your local dev environment, see [development setup](docs/dev/setup.md)

See the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to follow the latest progress of the implementations.
