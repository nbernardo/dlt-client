DLT Client is an MVP Data Engineering project designed to build ETL pipelines through a web interface, using low/no-code
features.

The front end is built using the <a href="https://stilljs.dev/">Still.js</a> framework and the Backend is built in 
<a href="https://dlthub.com/">dlt-hub (Python)</a>. This is a single repository comprising both the backend and the UI.

There is a [live version](https://mvp1.dlt-c.cloud/#) deployed in the cloud, you can access and test it using social login.

To learn how to set up your local dev environment, see [development setup](docs/dev/setup.md)

See the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to follow the latest progress of the implementations.
